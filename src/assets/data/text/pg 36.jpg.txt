UEC-2001 WET WEB STRENGTH TESTER
The UEC Wet Web Strength Tester is used for measuring the initial wet strength & elongation of newsprint strip or pulp intended for other purposes. The stress / strain chart, which is obtained as a result provides a basis for assessing the running characteristic of the product in the paper machine and for assessing the effect of pulp preparation variation. It measures the "Maximum Tensile Force per Unit Width" that, a "Wet Test Piece" (Prepared from a "Pulp under Specified Conditions") will stand before breaking in a Tensile Test. The equipment is very compact & easy to operate with LCD display of the test results. The clamping jaws are very precise to load & lock the wet pulp test samples (20 mm X 50 mm or 100 mm.) and the lower jaw automatically returns to the set point, after rupture of the sample. The measuring range of unit is 0-19.999 N with a deformation speed of 1.5 Â± 0.1 mm/sec.
